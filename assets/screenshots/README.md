# Screenshot Guide

Expected screenshot filenames referenced by the root `README.md`:
- `assets/screenshots/gui-pack.png`
- `assets/screenshots/gui-extract.png`
- `assets/screenshots/gui-list.png`
- `assets/screenshots/gui-verify.png`

Capture recommendations:
- Use release GUI build:
  - `cargo run --release --features gui --bin noer22_gui`
- Capture at ~1366x768 (or higher) to preserve readability.
- Use realistic but non-sensitive sample paths.
- Never expose real passwords, private keys, or age identities.
- Keep mode labels and primary action buttons visible in each screenshot.
